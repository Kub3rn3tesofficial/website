## Overview

There are two approaches for deploying a Kubernetes 1.4 cluster on Azure. Those are: 

* [Stackpoint.io](https://stackpoint.io/#/clusters/new?provider=azure) to build a cluster immediately.
* The [`kubernetes-anywhere`](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes-anywhere) project. You will want to take a look at the
[Azure Getting Started Guide](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes-anywhere/blob/master/phase1/azure/README.md).

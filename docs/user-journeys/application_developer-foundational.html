        If you're an application developer looking to get started with Kubernetes, this page and its linked topics introduce you to foundational concepts and tasks. The focus is on a development workflow -- check out other user journeys to learn about managing production clusters, or providing high availability (HA) for critical application deployments.</p>
        <p class="quotedocs">In a production workflow, it's common to assign the tasks and responsibilities of setting up and maintaining a Kubernetes cluster to the distinct roles of cluster administrator and cluster user. These roles might or might  not be assigned to different individuals or teams. As an application developer, you don't need to learn all the intricacies of cluster administration. But you do need to learn the basics, and to understand how certain aspects of administering a cluster can affect development, testing, and deployment at the application level.</p>

        <p>Kubernetes is commonly described as an orchestration platform for containerized applications. Containers provide lightweight portable packaging for applications, and Kubernetes helps deploy your containers to a cluster of connected computers and then manage the cluster. The cluster can run on bare metal, in classic virtual machines, or in the cloud.

            <div class="docscoltitle">Using Minikube to Create a Cluster</div>
            One good way to learn Kubernetes basics is with Minikube, which lets you create a simple single-node cluster. You can explore Minikube with the interactive online tutorials, or you can install it locally. <!--Alex: box link to Minikube interactive tutorial separately? --> If you install locally, you may find that your cluster is sufficient for local application development. Installing Minikube locally is also a good idea if you want to continue exploring in a persistent environment that you can come back to and change.
            <!--This link is for reference only atm. Wondering also about layout/presentation to show differences between these three ways of getting started in a more neutral way, something like "If you want to set up a cluster from scratch, here's the simplest local model that you might be able to extend into a dev environment" vs "If you want to start learning without the complexity of setting up the cluster (Katacoda)" vs "If you want to explore further without worrying about cluster setup (play with K8s)". Also WDYT of linking to Heptio's AWS QuickStart? It's dead simple from the console (a little trickier lately from the CLI but I can see whether we can fix that one up), gives you a cloud provider experience. Maybe GCP also? Or are we sliding too far into proprietary stuff? -->

        <p>One good way to learn Kubernetes basics is with Minikube, which lets you create a simple single-node cluster with all core Kubernetes components.

Installing Minikube locally is also a good idea if you want to continue exploring in a persistent environment that you can come back to and change.</p><!--Alex: this is the main box or section, that we want to keep as the intro to the main narrative that continues with "Before you install Minikube:" -->
        <p>If you're brand new to Kubernetes, you might want to try out the <a href="https://www.katacoda.com/courses/kubernetes/playground">Katacoda Kubernetes Playground</a>, which provides a set of web-based tutorials complete with their own Kubernetes environment.</p><!--Secondary box/callout -->

        To set up and explore your own Kubernetes cluster for the first time, you can create a simple cluster locally with Minikube. Minikube gives you a cluster with a single node and all core Kubernetes components. You can set up a Minikube cluster just to explore, or, depending on your application, Minikube can also provide a useful development environment.

        <p>You'll also want to think about storage. Kubernetes provides different types of storage for different storage needs:</p>

        <ul>
          <li>A Volume lets you define storage for your cluster that is tied to the lifecycle of a Pod. It is therefore more persistent than container storage. Learn <a href="https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/configure-pod-container/configure-volume-storage/">how to configure volume storage</a>, or <a href="https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/storage/volumes/">read more about about volume storage</a>.</li>
          <li>A PersistentVolume and PersistentVolumeClaim let you define storage at the cluster level. Typically a cluster administrator defines the PersistentVolume objects for the cluster, and cluster users (application developers, you) define the PersistentVolumeClaim objects that your application requires. Learn <a href="https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/configure-pod-container/configure-persistent-volume-storage/">how to set up persistent storage for your cluster</a> or <a href="https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/storage/persistent-volumes/">read more about persistent volumes</a>.</li>
          <!--<li>Q: mention also projected volumes? This seems more specialized, might be distracting?https://github.com/kubernetes/website/issues/4514 </li>-->
        </ul>

        <p>Labels let you specify identifying information for Kubernetes objects, such as pods, that you define. This information is entirely user-defined, and is used to sort and select sets of objects.</p>

        <ul>
          <li>When you <a href="https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/run-application/run-stateless-application-deployment/">create a basic nginx Deployment</a>, you specify the <code>app: nginx</code>label as part of the template metadata. The <code>matchLabels</code> selector then specifies this label as part of the spec.</li>
          <li><a href="https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/overview/working-with-objects/labels/">More about labels</a>
          </li>
          <li>You also specify labels to customize your cluster, for example by <a href="https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/configuration/assign-pod-node/">assigning pods to nodes</a>.</li>
          <li>https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/overview/working-with-objects/annotations/</li>
        </ul>

        <p>
          To provide configuration data for your application, you can specify Kubernetes environment variables as part of the container definition in your Deployment manifest. But to manage configuration data without having to rebuild your container or modify your Deployment, you can also <a href="https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/configure-pod-container/configmap/">use a ConfigMap</a> for non-confidential data, or <a href="https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/inject-data-application/distribute-credentials-secure/">a Secret</a> for confidential data.
        </p>

        <!--resource for re-doing docs: https://medium.com/google-cloud/kubernetes-configmaps-and-secrets-68d061f7ab5b -->

        <p>Note that ingress provides networking between your cluster and the outside world. A production cluster should also configure networking between containers and between nodes, which is <a href="https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/administer-cluster/declare-network-policy/">defined in a network policy</a>. <!-- See also:</p>

        <div class="quotedocs">Kubernetes is an open source system for managing containerized applications across multiple hosts, or nodes. It provides basic mechanisms to deploy, maintain, and scale your application.</div>
        <br>
        To work with Kubernetes, you describe your cluster's desired state in terms of Kubernetes API objects. Cluster state includes but is not limited to the following information:
        <ul>
          <li>The applications or other workloads to run</li>
          <li>The container images for your applications and workloads</li>
          <li>Allocation of network and disk resources</li>
        </ul>
        <br>
        Once you’ve set your desired state, the Kubernetes Control Plane works to make the cluster’s current state match the desired state. To do so, Kubernetes performs a variety of tasks automatically–such as starting or restarting containers, scaling the number of replicas of a given application, and more. The Kubernetes Control Plane consists of a collection of processes running on your cluster:
        <ul>
          <li>The Kubernetes Master is a collection of three processes that run on a single node in your cluster, which is designated as the master node. Those processes are: kube-apiserver, kube-controller-manager and kube-scheduler.</li>
          <li>Each individual non-master node in your cluster runs two processes:
            <ul>
              <li>kubelet, which communicates with the Kubernetes Master.</li>
              <li>kube-proxy, a network proxy which reflects Kubernetes networking services on each node.</li>
            </ul>
          </li>

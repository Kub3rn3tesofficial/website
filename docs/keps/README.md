# Kubernetes Enhancement Proposals (KEPs)

This directory contains both the template and process for KEPs.

This process is still in an _alpha_ state and is opt-in for those that want to provide feedback for the process.

## Directory structure

Most KEPs will be sponsored out of a specific SIG.  Those can be incubated inside of a subdirectory here for that SIG.  SIGs can add those directories and OWNERs files on an as needed basis.

Any KEPs that cross many SIG boundaries can be created at the root of the KEP directory.

## KEP numbering

The next dense number KEP will be 2.

To assign a number create a commit that both renames the KEP file and updates this file.

In process KEPs can use a date based numbering scheme. See [KEP-1](1-kubernetes-enhancement-proposal-process.md) for details of this process.

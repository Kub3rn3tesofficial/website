When writing docs, start with one of the five templates we provide:

Template | When to Use This | Download Link
--- | --- | --- | ---
[Overview](/docs/templates/overview/) | When you want to write an overview of X and its most commonly used elements (e.g. overview of APIs) | [download this](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes.github.io/tree/master/docs/templates/overview.md)
[Concept or in-depth guide](/docs/templates/concept-guide/) | When you want to explain X and how it works in detail (e.g. Deployment object concept) | [download this](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes.github.io/tree/master/docs/templates/concept-guide.md)
[Quickstart](/docs/templates/quickstart/) | When you want to get users working with the technology quickly by completing an introductory task within 5 minutes | [download this](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes.github.io/tree/master/docs/templates/quickstart.md)
[Tutorial / walkthrough / examples](/docs/templates/tutorial/) | When you want to teach key concepts step-by-step (in sequence) through real world examples; itâ€™s longer than quickstart | [download this](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes.github.io/tree/master/docs/templates/tutorial.md)
[How-tos / Task-based guide / Recipes](/docs/templates/how-tos/) | When you want to teach how to complete one or more independent (but related) tasks | [download this](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes.github.io/tree/master/docs/templates/how-tos.md)

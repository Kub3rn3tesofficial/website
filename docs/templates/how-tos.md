The how-tos should:

* Either have a single task using a sequence of steps 
* Or have multiple related short tasks (each < 2 screens long and can be done in random order)
* May include screenshots 
* Include only necessary conceptual information

Add the title in _data/reference.yml. The title should start with verb+ing

Add very short description here, which should include:

* Why should I read this / what this page describes? (1 sentence)
* Any background information I need to know (to understand what I’m going to do in this guide). (1 sentence)
* Links to more in-depth information  

Add TOC (we can omit TOC if there's only a single task):

* TOC
{:toc}

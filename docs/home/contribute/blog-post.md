## Add content to the file

Write your post using the following guidelines.

### Kubernetes blog guidelines

All content must be original. The Kubernetes blog does not post material previously published elsewhere.

Suitable Content (with examples):

- User case studies (Yahoo Japan, Bitmovin)
- New Kubernetes capabilities (5-days-of-k8s)
- Kubernetes projects updates (kompose)
- Updates from Special Interest Groups (SIG-OpenStack)
- Tutorials and walkthroughs (PostgreSQL w/ StatefulSets)
- Thought leadership around Kubernetes (CaaS, the foundation for next generation PaaS)
- Kubernetes Partner OSS integration (Fission)

Unsuitable Content:

- Vendor product pitches
- Partner updates without an integration and customer story
- Syndicated posts (language translations are permitted)

## Add images

Add any image files the post contains to `/images/`. The preferred
image format is SVG.

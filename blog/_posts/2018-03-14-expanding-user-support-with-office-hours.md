<div><div>***Today's post is by Jorge Castro and Ilya Dmitichenko on 
Kubernetes office hours. ***<div> 
Today’s developer has an almost overwhelming amount of resources available for 
learning. Kubernetes development teams use 
[StackOverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/kubernetes), [user 
documentation](https://kubernetes.io/docs/home), 
[Slack](http://slack.k8s.io/), and the [mailing 
lists](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/kubernetes-users). 
Additionally, the community itself continues to amass an [awesome 
list](https://github.com/ramitsurana/awesome-kubernetes) of resources. 

One of the challenges of large projects is keeping user resources relevant and 
useful. While documentation can be useful, great learning also happens in 
Q&amp;A sessions at conferences, or by learning with someone whose explanation 
matches your learning style. Consider that learning Kung Fu from Morpheus 
would be a lot more fun than reading a book about Kung Fu!

<span id="goog_1679875515"> We as Kubernetes developers want to create an 
interactive experience: where Kubernetes users can get their questions 
answered by experts in real time, or at least referred to the best known 
documentation or code example. 

Having discussed a few broad ideas, we eventually decided to make [Kubernetes 
Office 
Hours](https://github.com/kubernetes/community/blob/master/events/office-hours.md) 
a live stream where we take user questions from the audience and present them 
to our panel of contributors and expert users. We run two sessions: one for 
European time zones, and one for the Americas. These [streaming setup 
guidelines](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1jHSnRzoOxwd1urgxwbANhNgXjMV8fb0B4NS3ZUL10IY/edit) 
make office hours extensible—for example, if someone wants to run office hours 
for Asia/Pacific timezones, or for another CNCF project. 

To give you an idea of what Kubernetes office hours are like, here’s Josh 
Berkus answering a question on running databases on Kubernetes. Despite the 
popularity of this topic, it’s still difficult for a new user to get a 
constructive answer. Here’s an excellent response from Josh: 

<div style="text-align: center;"><iframe allow="autoplay; encrypted-media" 
allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="315"

It’s often easier to field this kind of question in office hours than it is to 
ask a developer to write a full-length blog post. [Editor’s note: That’s 
legit!] Because we don’t have infinite developers with infinite time, this 
kind of focused communication creates high-bandwidth help while limiting 
developer commitments to 1 hour per month. This allows a rotating set of 
experts to share the load without overwhelming any one person. 

We hold office hours the third Wednesday of every month on the [Kubernetes 
YouTube Channel](https://www.youtube.com/c/kubernetescommunity). You can post 
questions on the [#office-hours 
channel](https://kubernetes.slack.com/messages/office-hours) on Slack, or you 
can submit your question to Stack Overflow and post a link on Slack. If you 
post a question in advance, you might get better answers, as volunteers have 
more time to research and prepare. If a question can’t be fully solved during 
the call, the team will try their best to point you in the right direction 
and/or ping other people in the community to take a look. [Check out this 
page](https://github.com/kubernetes/community/blob/master/events/office-hours.md) 
for more details on what’s off- and on topic as well as meeting information 
for your time zone. We hope to hear your questions soon! 

Special thanks to Amazon, Bitnami, Giant Swarm, Heptio, Liquidweb, 
Northwestern Mutual, Packet.net, Pivotal, Red Hat, Weaveworks, and VMWare for 
donating engineering time to office hours. 

And thanks to Alan Pope, Joe Beda, and Charles Butler for technical support in 
making our livestream better.

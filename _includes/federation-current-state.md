**Note:** The current kubernetes federation API which reuses the kubernetes API 
resources 'as is' (`Federation V1` as we like to call it), is currently considered 
alpha for many of its features and there is no clear path to evolve the API to GA. 
There however is effort ongoing to implement a dedicated federation API, different 
from k8s API (`Federation V2` as we like to call it); the details of which can be 
found at [sig-multicluster community page](https://github.com/kubernetes/community/tree/master/sig-multicluster).

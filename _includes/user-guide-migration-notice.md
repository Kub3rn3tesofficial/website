##NOTICE

As of March 14, 2017, the [@kubernetes/sig-docs-maintainers](https://github.com/orgs/kubernetes/teams/sig-docs-maintainers) have begun migration of the User Guide content as announced previously to the [SIG Docs community](https://github.com/kubernetes/community/tree/master/sig-docs) through the [kubernetes-sig-docs](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/kubernetes-sig-docs) group and [kubernetes.slack.com #sig-docs](https://kubernetes.slack.com/messages/sig-docs/) channel. 

The user guides within this section are being refactored into topics within Tutorials, Tasks, and Concepts. Anything that has been moved will have a notice placed in its previous location as well as a link to its new location. The reorganization implements the table of contents (ToC) outlined in the [kubernetes-docs-toc](https://docs.google.com/a/google.com/document/d/18hRCIorVarExB2eBVHTUR6eEJ2VVk5xq1iBmkQv8O6I/edit?usp=sharing) document and should better facilitate the findability and consumption of the content for a wider range of audiences.

For any questions, please contact: kubernetes-sig-docs@googlegroups.com

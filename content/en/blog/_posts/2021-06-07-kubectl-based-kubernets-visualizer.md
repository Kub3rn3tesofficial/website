Using kubectl commands can be challenging for beginners of the system. Many of the cloud kubernets providers are not giving GUI for accessing and viewing the kubernets cluster.

I have developed a utility with minimal commands to provide the kubernets operation using GUI.

## Steps

- Clone the repo https://github.com/anasokan/kubevisualizer
- Pick a stable release and open the jar in release folder.
- Pick the desired namespace and desired pod.
- Perform the required operation.

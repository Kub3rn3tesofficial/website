Hi Team, Hope you are doing well, I have a small question around one of the article which I am writing, will this be a good fit from publishing perspective?

Title: Installing multiple helm charts in one go using helmfile

TOC:
- What is helmfile?
- Bit of a intro about why this is needed?
- How to get this installed?
- What are its prerequisites?
- The helmfile.yaml? and its important KV/items?
- Hands-on example?
- Etc

I have already started writing this one and it is a part of my 3 series articles but just wanted to check if this article `2` can fit in?

Please refer this URL for more details, its still in progress and I intend to complete this in next few days: https://github.com/sunnybhambhani/todayslearning/blob/main/helm_installer_approach2.md

The 3 series article which I was talking about is described here: https://dev.to/aws-builders/installing-multiple-helm-charts-in-one-go-approach-1-5d1p

Thank you,
Sunny

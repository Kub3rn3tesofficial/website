[CNCF Survey](https://www.cncf.io/blog/2018/08/29/cncf-survey-use-of-cloud-native-technologies-in-production-has-grown-over-200-percent/) clearly shows that usage of Clound Native technologies in production grows rapidly. Kubernetes plays a very important role in this trend, and this is the fact. The thing is that like with any other technology, as it evolves, and the ecosystem grows, the complexity increases as well. Try to google `kubernetes is hard` and you get a list of different articles that address this problem. This is normal, and best thing about CNCF community is that these problems are addressed with projects like Knative and for example its [Build resource](https://github.com/knative/build).

## Picking the right technology is hard 

Now, once you understand Kubernetes, your teams are trained, start building apps on top. You face another difficulty. Cloud Native is not just PaaS solution. Writing an application is the easiest part really, but what about logging? monitoring? tracing? alerting? service mesh? storage?. These are all the questions you need to answer, and you need to perform a proper investigation that takes time. CNCFs helps here a lot by providing a [landscape](https://landscape.cncf.io/) of all the cloud native technologies, but the list is huge and overwhelming. 

Kyma solves that issue, provides all tools glued together with 3 core concepts

The best thing is that there is a big player behind the project and gives it to their customers. Thanks to that we made sure it is stable and available with major 1.0 release

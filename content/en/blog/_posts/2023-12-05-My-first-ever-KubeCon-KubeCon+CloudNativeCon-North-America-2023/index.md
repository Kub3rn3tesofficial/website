_This post is a guide for beginners to look at huge and overwhelming events like KubeCon._

This blog is a personal journey and beginner's guide for those encountering a significant conference for the first time. KubeCon marks my inaugural conference, and it's undeniably the largest. Previously, I've been to community-driven events like Google Cloud Community Days Kolkata 2023, Kubernetes Community Days Mumbai 2023, and KubeDay India 2023; they were sizable but lasted only a day or two. In contrast, KubeCon was significantly larger and more overwhelming, especially for newcomers in the field.

My introduction to KubeCon was virtual, thanks to the Dan Kohn Scholarship, which granted me access to attend remotely. Before delving into my event experiences, let's first explore the fundamentals of this event and others hosted by the Cloud Native Computing Foundation.

Like any other event, you need to register at their official site. You can learn about upcoming events on their [official page](https://www.cncf.io/events/). Sometimes it might be not easy to afford the cost of attending these events, but CNCF also offers scholarships to individuals. To provide an overview, CNCF mainly offers scholarships based on 3 categories namely - Diversity, Need-Based, and Maintainer.

KubeCon serves as a dynamic platform for attendees to actively engage with the expansive Kubernetes community. Through a diverse array of networking avenues, including Birds of a Feather sessions, social events, and dedicated breaks, participants have the opportunity to connect with fellow developers, contributors, and users of Kubernetes.

These interactions foster collaboration and facilitate the exchange of knowledge and experiences. The conference's emphasis on networking creates an environment where like-minded professionals and industry experts can forge connections, share insights, and collectively contribute to the ever-evolving landscape of container orchestration and cloud-native technologies.

# General Information about KubeCon

This year's KubeCon North America 2023 was held from November 6th to 9th of 2023 in Chicago, Illinois.

Education and collaboration are vital to the future of the CNCF ecosystem. It's imperative to CNCF that everyone in the community who wants to participate feels welcome, regardless of gender, gender identity, sexual orientation, dis/ability, race, ethnicity, age, religion, or economic status.

Every KubeCon has more or less the same schedule except for the talks. The talks vary depending on the [CFPs](https://events.linuxfoundation.org/kubecon-cloudnativecon-europe/program/cfp/) submitted. To give a very basic plot of the event, This was the schedule of KubeCon 2023:

In case you want to check the full schedule, click [here](https://events.linuxfoundation.org/kubecon-cloudnativecon-north-america/program/schedule/). You can change the timezone of the schedule according to your local time.

For a beginner attending KubeCon can be overwhelming. Some might consider leaving tech and open-source. But hold your nerve. There's a place for everyone in the community. As a beginner, I'd suggest carefully examining the schedule for talks aligned with your interests. Keynotes, mainly by CNCF Ambassadors, are crucial for beginners.

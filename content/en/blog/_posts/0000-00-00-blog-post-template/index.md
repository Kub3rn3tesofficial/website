This file is a template for you to write a blog post. Replace the content in it with your own. This first paragraph summarizes the post. Keep it short and sweet. Focus on your main idea.

## Do questions make good headings?

Yes, questions trigger curiosity and prepare readers for the information you're about to deliver. You can also use non-question headings. The important thing is to use headings to organize your content into chunks of related information that are easier to consume than a "wall of text".

Also avoid long complicated sentences. If a sentence exceeds twenty words, start looking for ways to break it in two. Replace complicated words and phrases with simpler ones. Consider using a third-party tool that checks for spelling, grammar, and style.

## Go slow to go fast

To save time and do well, take a little while to review these documents:

* [Submitting blog posts and case studies](/docs/contribute/new-content/blogs-case-studies/)
* [Documentation style guide](/docs/contribute/style/style-guide)

It might be helful to find a post you like in the [Kubernetes blog](https://kubernetes.io/blog/) and review its [its markdown source code](https://github.com/kubernetes/website/tree/master/content/en/blog/_posts).

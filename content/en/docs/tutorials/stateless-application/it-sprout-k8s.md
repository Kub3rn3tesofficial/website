 The project includes GitHub Actions pipelines for deploying Kubernetes and Tekton, configuring MySQL, and deploying WordPress images. Each WordPress instance is set up as a read-only image with its own URI and SSL, and can be replicated as needed to handle different levels of traffic. WordPress instances can also be updated easily with new plugins or themes, and Tekton will automatically build and deploy the new version.

## Basic Concepts 123

### Image

_An Image_ is a binary package that contains all of the files necessary to run an application inside of an operating system container.
For better understanding, you can think of an image as a class in a programming language and a container as an instance of that class.

### Container

A _container_ is an active instantiation of an image.

Containers sit on a physical or a virtual host machine and run on the host’s operating system. This makes containers lightweight and portable: only megabytes in size. Containers help ensure that applications deploy quickly unlike virtual machines which are bulky and take a longer time to reboot.

Example:


### Container Runtime

_Container Runtime_ is a program that runs on nodes and sets up containers for you by instantiating an image into a container.


### Control Loop

_Control Loop_ is a non-terminating loop that regulates the state of the system through the apiserver and makes changes attempting to move the current state towards the desired state.

Example: If there are currently 2 pods (current state) running in a node, however you want 3 additional pods(desired state) in a node, control loop ensures to spin up 3 additional pods.

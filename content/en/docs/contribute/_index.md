The Kubernetes website loves all contributions from new members and experienced ones! Compared to other parts of the Kubernetes project, documentation is an easy way to
get involved and have impact, especially for new contributors.

## Getting started

Anyone can open an issue about documentation, or contribute a change with a pull request (PR).
Some tasks require more trust and need more access in the Kubernetes organization.
See [Participating in SIG Docs](/docs/contribute/participating/) for more details about
of roles and permissions.

Kubernetes documentation resides in a GitHub repository.
You need to be comfortable with git and GitHub to
operate effectively in the Kubernetes community.

To get involved with documentation:

1. Sign the CNCF [Contributor License Agreement](https://github.com/kubernetes/community/blob/master/CLA.md).
2. Familiarize yourself with the [documentation repository](https://github.com/kubernetes/website) and the website's [static site generator](https://gohugo.io).
3. Make sure you understand the basic processes for [improving content](https://kubernetes.io/docs/contribute/start/#improve-existing-content) and [reviewing changes](https://kubernetes.io/docs/contribute/start/#review-docs-pull-requests).

## Good first contributions for beginners

If you're new to Kubernetes, working in GitHub, or working on documentation, start here:

- [Suggest improvements](/docs/contribute/suggest-improvements/) to existing documentation and learn more about filing issues in GitHub.
- Contribute a [small change](/docs/contribute/new-content/new-content/#small-changes) to existing content to learn the pull review process.
- [Review pull requests](/docs/contribute/review/reviewing/) from other Kubernetes community members for accuracy and language.
- Read the Kubernetes [content](/docs/contribute/style/content-guide/) and [style guide](/docs/contribute/style/style-guide/) to make your improvements better.
- Learn how to [use page templates](/docs/contribute/style/page-templates/) and [Hugo shortcodes](/docs/contribute/style/hugo-shortcodes/) to make bigger changes.

## Contributions that require more knowledge

If you're comfortable with static site generators, GitHub, or Kubernetes, or are looking to
get involved in a larger way, start here:

- Learn [work from a local clone](/docs/contribute/new-content/working-locally/) of the repository if you're new to GitHub.
- Contribute a [larger change](/docs/contribute/new-content/new-content/#large-changes) to documentation.
- Learn how to help with or document [new features](/docs/contribute/new-content/new-features/).
- Participate in [SIG Docs](/docs/contribute/participating/),  become a [member or reviewer](/docs/contribute/participating/#roles-and-responsibilities).
- Start or participate in a [localization](/docs/contribute/localization/) of Kubernetes documentation.

## Get involved with SIG Docs

[SIG Docs](/docs/contribute/participating/) is the group of contributors who are responsible for documentation. Getting involved with SIG Docs is a great way for Kubernetes contributors (feature development or otherwise) to have a large impact on the Kubernetes project.

The SIG Docs team communicates using the following mechanisms:

- [Join the Kubernetes Slack instance](http://slack.k8s.io/), then join the
  `#sig-docs` channel to discuss docs issues in real-time. Be sure to
  introduce yourself!
- [Join the `kubernetes-sig-docs` mailing list](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/kubernetes-sig-docs),
  where broader discussions take place and official decisions are recorded.
- Join the [weekly SIG Docs video meeting](https://github.com/kubernetes/community/tree/master/sig-docs). The meeting is always announced on the Slack channel and the mailing list. Currently, these meetings take place on Zoom, so you'll need to download the [Zoom client](https://zoom.us/download) or dial in using a phone.
- Check the SIG Docs weekly meeting times on the [Kubernetes community meetings calendar](https://calendar.google.com/calendar/embed?src=cgnt364vd8s86hr2phapfjc6uk%40group.calendar.google.com&ctz=America/Los_Angeles).

## Other ways to contribute

- Visit the [Kubernetes community site](/community/) to participate on Twitter or Stack Overflow, learn about local Kubernetes meetups and events, and more.
- Read the [contributor cheatsheet](https://github.com/kubernetes/community/tree/master/contributors/guide/contributor-cheatsheet) to get involved with Kubernetes feature development.
- Submit a [blog post or case study](/docs/contribute/new-content/blogs-case-studies/).

If you would like to help contribute to the Kubernetes documentation or website,
we're happy to have your help! Anyone can contribute, whether you're new to the
project or you've been around a long time, and whether you self-identify as a
developer, an end user, or someone who just can't stand seeing typos.

Looking for the [style guide](/docs/contribute/style/style-guide/)?

## Ways to contribute

This is not an exhaustive list of ways you can contribute to the Kubernetes
documentation, but it should get your juices flowing.

This list is divided into things anyone can do, things Kubernetes project
members can do, and things Kubernetes maintainers can do. The intent is not to
throttle contributions or limit who can do what. Some of the more advanced tasks
require a good understanding of Kubernetes itself, and some of them require a
good understanding of how the Kubernetes documentation toolchain works. In
addition, sticking around for a while helps you understand some of the tooling
and organizational decisions that have already been made.

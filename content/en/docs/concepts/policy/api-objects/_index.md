 Some API objects such as [Network Policies](/docs/concepts/services-networking/network-policies/), [Limit Ranges](/docs/concepts/policy/api-objects/limit-range/), and [Resource Quotas](/docs/concepts/policy/api-objects/resource-quotas/) act as policies. For example, a NetworkPolicy can be used to restrict ingress and egress traffic for a workload.

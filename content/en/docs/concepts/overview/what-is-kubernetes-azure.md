<h2>Why use Kubernetes?</h2>

Maintaining containerized applications can be complicated because it usually involves multiple containers deployed across different nodes or machines, usually virtual machines. Kubernetes is an orchestration platform that allows the scheduling and deployment of containers at scale. Scaling and resilient deployments can be automated through Kubernetes. Furthermore, using a cloud managed deployment of Kubernetes can further reduce operational costs by minimizing the complexity of maintaining infrastructure.

Since containers add another layer of abstraction on top of  infrastructure, they are inherently portable when deployed on Kubernetes. Developers can deploy on local machines, servers in data centers, and hybrid and multiple cloud environments. The orchestration platform and APIs remain identical regardless of which infrastructure platform is chosen.

Developers can use YAML to define complex applications and deploy them across multiple servers and autoscale depending on application state requirements. In addition, Kubernetes also monitors and maintains container health to help with keeping applications up and running.

<!-- overview -->

This documentation is about investigating and diagnosing connectivity issues between
`kubectl` and your Kubernetes cluster. If you are unable to connect to your cluster
using `kubectl`, this document describes several common scenarios and potential
solutions to identify and address the likely cause.

Before proceeding with the troubleshooting guide, please ensure that you have already
installed and set up `kubectl` on your local machine and have the appropriate permissions
to access the Kubernetes cluster.

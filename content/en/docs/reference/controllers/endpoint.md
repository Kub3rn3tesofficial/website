{{% capture overview %}}

This controller makes sure that {{< glossary_tooltip text="Services" term_id="service" >}}
have an Endpoint for each Pod that matches the Services' label selector.

The endpoint controller is built in to kube-controller-manager.

## Controller behavior

The controller watches for Service and Pod objects. For each Service, this
controller normally adds or removes Endpoints so that the each Pod has a matching
Endpoint.

If you define a Service without a selector, this controller will *not* create
Endpoints for that Service. You can instead manually map the service to the
network address and port where itâ€™s running, by adding an Endpoint object manually.

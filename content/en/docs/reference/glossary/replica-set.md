 A ReplicaSetâ€™s purpose is to maintain a stable set of replica {{< glossary_tooltip text="Pods" term_id="pod" >}} running at any given time. As such, it is often used to guarantee the availability of a specified number of identical Pods.

this is more common than configuring a ReplicaSet directly.

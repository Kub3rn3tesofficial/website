Quantity refers to a specific amount of a resource, such as CPU or memory, that is allocated to a Pod in which a container is running. 
For example, a pod may be allocated 1 CPU core and 2 gigabytes of memory, which would be specified as "1 CPU" and "2Gi" for the respective resources. These quantities are used by the Kubernetes scheduler to determine which nodes have the available resources to run a pod, and to ensure that pods do not consume more resources than they are allocated.

CIDR ( Classless Inter-Domain Routing) is a notation for describing blocks of IP addresses and is used heavily in various networking configurations.

<!--more-->

It is an IP addressing scheme that replaces the older system based on classes A, B, and C. With CIDR, a single IP address can be used to designate many unique IP addresses. A CIDR IP address looks like a normal IP address except that it ends with a slash followed by a number, called the IP network prefix.

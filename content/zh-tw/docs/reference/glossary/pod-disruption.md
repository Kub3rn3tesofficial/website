<!--
[Pod disruption](/docs/concepts/workloads/pods/disruptions/) is the process by which 
Pods on Nodes are terminated either voluntarily or involuntarily. 
-->

[pod 干擾](/zh-cn/docs/concepts/workloads/pods/disruptions/) 是指節點上的 pod 被自願或非自願終止的過程。

<!--more--> 

<!--
Voluntary disruptions are started intentionally by application owners or cluster 
administrators. Involuntary disruptions are unintentional and can be triggered by 
unavoidable issues like Nodes running out of resources, or by accidental deletions. 
-->

自願干擾是由應用程式所有者或叢集管理員有意啟動的。非自願干擾是無意的，可能由不可避免的問題觸發，如節點耗盡資源或意外刪除。

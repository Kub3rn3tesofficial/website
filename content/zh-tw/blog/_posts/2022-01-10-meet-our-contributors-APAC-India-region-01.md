大家好 👋

<!--
Welcome to the first episode of the APAC edition of the "Meet Our Contributors" blog post series.
-->
歡迎來到亞太地區的“認識我們的貢獻者”博文系列第一期。


<!--
In this post, we'll introduce you to five amazing folks from the India region who have been actively contributing to the upstream Kubernetes projects in a variety of ways, as well as being the leaders or maintainers of numerous community initiatives.
-->
在這篇文章中，我們將向您介紹來自印度地區的五位優秀貢獻者，他們一直在以各種方式積極地為上游 Kubernetes 專案做貢獻，同時也是眾多社群倡議的領導者和維護者。

<!--
💫 *Let's get started, so without further ado…* 
-->
💫 *閒話少說，我們開始吧。*


## [Arsh Sharma](https://github.com/RinkiyaKeDad)

<!--
Arsh is currently employed with Okteto as a Developer Experience engineer. As a new contributor, he realised that 1:1 mentorship opportunities were quite beneficial in getting him started with the upstream project.
-->
Arsh 目前在 Okteto 公司中擔任開發者體驗工程師職務。作為一名新的貢獻者，他意識到一對一的指導機會讓他在開始上游專案中受益匪淺。

<!--
He is presently a CI Signal shadow on the Kubernetes 1.23 release team. He is also contributing to the SIG Testing and SIG Docs projects, as well as to the [cert-manager](https://github.com/cert-manager/infrastructure) tools development work that is being done under the aegis of SIG Architecture.
-->
他目前是 Kubernetes 1.23 版本團隊的 CI Signal 經理。他還致力於為 SIG Testing 和 SIG Docs 專案提供貢獻，並且在 SIG Architecture 專案中負責 [證書管理器](https://github.com/cert-manager/infrastructure) 工具的開發工作。

<!--
To the newcomers, Arsh helps plan their early contributions sustainably.
-->
對於新人來說，Arsh 幫助他們可持續地計劃早期貢獻。

<!--
> _I would encourage folks to contribute in a way that's sustainable. What I mean by that
> is that it's easy to be very enthusiastic early on and take up more stuff than one can
> actually handle. This can often lead to burnout in later stages. It's much more sustainable
> to work on things iteratively._
-->
> _我鼓勵大家以可持續的方式為社群做貢獻。我的意思是，一個人很容易在早期的時候非常有熱情，並且承擔了很多超出個人實際能力的事情。這通常會導致後期的倦怠。迭代地處理事情會讓大家對社群的貢獻變得可持續。_

## [Kunal Kushwaha](https://github.com/kunal-kushwaha)

<!--
Kunal Kushwaha is a core member of the Kubernetes marketing council. He is also a CNCF ambassador and one of the founders of the [CNCF Students Program](https://community.cncf.io/cloud-native-students/).. He also served as a Communications role shadow during the 1.22 release cycle.
-->
Kunal Kushwaha 是 Kubernetes 營銷委員會的核心成員。他同時也是 [CNCF 學生計劃](https://community.cncf.io/cloud-native-students/) 的創始人之一。他還在 1.22 版本週期中擔任通訊經理一職。

<!--
At the end of his first year, Kunal began contributing to the [fabric8io kubernetes-client](https://github.com/fabric8io/kubernetes-client) project. He was then selected to work on the same project as part of Google Summer of Code. Kunal mentored people on the same project, first through Google Summer of Code then through Google Code-in. 
-->
在他的第一年結束時，Kunal 開始為 [fabric8io kubernetes-client](https://github.com/fabric8io/kubernetes-client) 專案做貢獻。然後，他被推選從事同一專案，此專案是 Google Summer of Code 的一部分。Kunal 在 Google Summer of Code、Google Code-in 等專案中指導過很多人。

<!--
As an open-source enthusiast, he believes that diverse participation in the community is beneficial since it introduces new perspectives and opinions and respect for one's peers. He has worked on various open-source projects, and his participation in communities has considerably assisted his development as a developer.
-->
作為一名開源愛好者，他堅信，社群的多元化參與是非常有益的，因為他引入了新的觀念和觀點，並尊重自己的夥伴。它曾參與過各種開源專案，他在這些社群中的參與對他作為開發者的發展有很大幫助。


<!--
> _I believe if you find yourself in a place where you do not know much about the
> project, that's a good thing because now you can learn while contributing and the
> community is there to help you. It has helped me a lot in gaining skills, meeting
> people from around the world and also helping them. You can learn on the go,
> you don't have to be an expert. Make sure to also check out no code contributions
> because being a beginner is a skill and you can bring new perspectives to the
> organisation._
-->
> _我相信，如果你發現自己在一個瞭解不多的專案當中，那是件好事，因為現在你可以一邊貢獻一邊學習，社群也會幫助你。它幫助我獲得了很多技能，認識了來自世界各地的人，也幫助了他們。你可以在這個過程中學習，自己不一定必須是專家。請重視非程式碼貢獻，因為作為初學者這是一項技能，你可以為組織帶來新的視角。_

## [Madhav Jivarajani](https://github.com/MadhavJivrajani)


<!--
Madhav Jivarajani works on the VMware Upstream Kubernetes stability team. He began contributing to the Kubernetes project in January 2021 and has since made significant contributions to several areas of work under SIG Architecture, SIG API Machinery, and SIG ContribEx (contributor experience).
-->
Madhav Jivarajani 在 VMware 上游 Kubernetes 穩定性團隊工作。他於 2021 年 1 月開始為 Kubernetes 專案做貢獻，此後在 SIG Architecture、SIG API Machinery 和 SIG ContribEx（貢獻者經驗）等專案的幾個工作領域做出了重大貢獻。

<!--
Among several significant contributions are his recent efforts toward the Archival of [design proposals](https://github.com/kubernetes/community/issues/6055), refactoring the ["groups" codebase](https://github.com/kubernetes/k8s.io/pull/2713) under k8s-infra repository to make it mockable and testable, and improving the functionality of the [GitHub k8s bot](https://github.com/kubernetes/test-infra/issues/23129).
-->
在這幾個重要專案中，他最近致力於 [設計方案](https://github.com/kubernetes/community/issues/6055) 的存檔工作，重構 k8s-infra 儲存庫下的 ["組"程式碼庫](https://github.com/kubernetes/k8s.io/pull/2713) ，使其具有可模擬性和可測試性，以及改進 [GitHub k8s 機器人](https://github.com/kubernetes/test-infra/issues/23129) 的功能。

<!--
In addition to his technical efforts, Madhav oversees many projects aimed at assisting new contributors. He organises bi-weekly "KEP reading club" sessions to help newcomers understand the process of adding new features, deprecating old ones, and making other key changes to the upstream project. He has also worked on developing [Katacoda scenarios](https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/contributor-katacoda) to assist new contributors to become acquainted with the process of contributing to k/k. In addition to his current efforts to meet with community members every week, he has organised several [new contributors workshops (NCW)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FgsXbHBRYIc).
-->
除了在技術方面的貢獻，Madhav 還監督許多旨在幫助新貢獻者的專案。他每兩週組織一次的“KEP 閱讀俱樂部”會議，幫助新人瞭解新增新功能、摒棄舊功能以及對上游專案進行其他關鍵更改的過程。他還致力於開發 [Katacoda 場景](https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/contributor-katacoda) ，以幫助新的貢獻者在為 k/k 做貢獻的過程更加熟練。目前除了每週與社群成員會面外，他還組織了幾個 [新貢獻者講習班（NCW）](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FgsXbHBRYIc) 。

<!--
> _I initially did not know much about Kubernetes. I joined because the community was
> super friendly. But what made me stay was not just the people, but the project itself.
> My solution to not feeling overwhelmed in the community was to gain as much context
> and knowledge into the topics that I was interested in and were being discussed. And
> as a result I continued to dig deeper into Kubernetes and the design of it.
> I am a systems nut & thus Kubernetes was an absolute goldmine for me._
-->
> _一開始我對 Kubernetes 瞭解並不多。我加入社群是因為社群超級友好。但讓我留下來的不僅僅是人，還有專案本身。我在社群中不會感到不知所措，這是因為我能夠在感興趣的和正在討論的主題中獲得儘可能多的背景和知識。因此，我將繼續深入探討 Kubernetes 及其設計。我是一個系統迷，kubernetes 對我來說絕對是一個金礦。_


## [Rajas Kakodkar](https://github.com/rajaskakodkar)

<!--
Rajas Kakodkar currently works at VMware as a Member of Technical Staff. He has been engaged in many aspects of the upstream Kubernetes project since 2019.
-->
Rajas Kakodkar 目前在 VMware 擔任技術人員。自 2019 年以來，他一直多方面地從事上游 kubernetes 專案。

<!--
He is now a key contributor to the Testing special interest group. He is also active in the SIG Network community. Lately, Rajas has contributed significantly to the [NetworkPolicy++](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1AtWQy2fNa4qXRag9cCp5_HsefD7bxKe3ea2RPn8jnSs/) and [`kpng`](https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/kpng) sub-projects.
-->
他現在是 Testing 特別興趣小組的關鍵貢獻者。他還活躍在 SIG Network 社群。最近，Rajas 為 [NetworkPolicy++](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1AtWQy2fNa4qXRag9cCp5_HsefD7bxKe3ea2RPn8jnSs/) 和 [`kpng`](https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/kpng) 子專案做出了重大貢獻。

<!--
One of the first challenges he ran across was that he was in a different time zone than the upstream project's regular meeting hours. However, async interactions on community forums progressively corrected that problem.
-->
他遇到的第一個挑戰是，他所處的時區與上游專案的日常會議時間不同。不過，社群論壇上的非同步互動逐漸解決了這個問題。

<!--
> _I enjoy contributing to Kubernetes not just because I get to work on
> cutting edge tech but more importantly because I get to work with
> awesome people and help in solving real world problems._
-->
> _我喜歡為 kubernetes 做出貢獻，不僅因為我可以從事尖端技術工作，更重要的是，我可以和優秀的人一起工作，並幫助解決現實問題。_

## [Rajula Vineet Reddy](https://github.com/rajula96reddy)

<!--

-->
Rajula Vineet Reddy，CERN 的初級工程師，是 SIG ContribEx 專案下營銷委員會的成員。在 Kubernetes 1.22 和 1.23 版本週期中，他還擔任 SIG Release 的版本經理。

<!--
He started looking at the Kubernetes project as part of a university project with the help of one of his professors. Over time, he spent a significant amount of time reading the project's documentation, Slack discussions, GitHub issues, and blogs, which helped him better grasp the Kubernetes project and piqued his interest in contributing upstream. One of his key contributions was his assistance with automation in the SIG ContribEx Upstream Marketing subproject.
-->
在他的一位教授的幫助下，他開始將 kubernetes 專案作為大學專案的一部分。慢慢地，他花費了大量的時間閱讀專案的文件、Slack 討論、GitHub issues 和部落格，這有助於他更好地掌握 kubernetes 專案，並激發了他對上游專案做貢獻的興趣。他的主要貢獻之一是他在SIG ContribEx上游營銷子專案中協助實現了自動化。

<!--
According to Rajula, attending project meetings and shadowing various project roles are vital for learning about the community.
-->
Rajas 說，參與專案會議和跟蹤各種專案角色對於瞭解社群至關重要。

<!--
> _I find the community very helpful and it's always_
> “you get back as much as you contribute”.
> _The more involved you are, the more you will understand, get to learn and
> contribute new things._
> 
> _The first step to_ “come forward and start” _is hard. But it's all gonna be
> smooth after that. Just take that jump._
-->
> _我發現社群非常有幫助，而且總是“你得到的回報和你貢獻的一樣多”。你參與得越多，你就越會了解、學習和貢獻新東西。_
> _“挺身而出”的第一步是艱難的。但在那之後一切都會順利的。勇敢地參與進來吧。_

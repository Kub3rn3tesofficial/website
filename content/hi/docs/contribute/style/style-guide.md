## 1. WHY?

We have great responsibility whenever we touch a key on a keyboard to translate anything into Hindi. The responsibility of conveying the message of any source text into Hindi is having the responsibility to convey it to millions of users. And so, the problem is acute. Hindi is not just a language in India. Hindi is not just one culture of India. Combine many languages, cultures, dialects, and traditions – the one result you will get is Hindi. That is why it is not a simple job to define what Hindi is. You can find different Hindi from Kashmir to Kanyakumari and From Gujarat to Arunachal Pradesh. That is why translating to Hindi is more challenging than it appears.

Language is like running water. The field of computer translation is very new, so many experiments are happening daily. Until today, in the open content zone, there is nothing like a style guide that normal users can use. The style guide will help make the translation continuously better. Fairer, More accurate, more consistent. It will try to connect better with the audience. This guide isn't a simple do and don't. The style & convention guide will try to help translators, and interested localization engineers, increase the understandability of several aspects of translating any text in Hindi. This guide will discuss Fonts, Colla­tion, Numerals, Calendars, acronyms, Glossaries, Punctuations, White Spaces, and Message Lengths, to name a few. These are fundamental things, but these aspects need much attention, and also, understanding these things is mandatory for a translator before translating any text into Hindi.

Questions can arise that following a style guide can be a hindrance in the development of any language. But the fact is that style guide is not a barrier in the development of language but it helps in the development of a language by making any text more useful and understandable for a group of people. Particularly it is im­portant and almost mandatory for technical translation. For example, when we are translating any manual, software etc. some sort of consistency is needed to make user comfortable with the user interface, its manual etc.  

A proper communications is very much necessary particularly in the case of Open Source and Free soft­ ware communities where continuously new translators are joining in their community team and start working on their language. They should know the method and ways by which translation are being done in the com­munity. So there should be some set of guidelines for the volunteers who are coming in the filed of transla­tion. Apart from tools to translate and translators' know how, three important resources are required: 1. Ter­minology, 2. Translation Style and conventions Guide, and 3. Quality Assessment Guidelines and related Ma­trix. But we lack the above mentioned resources in Hindi. Particularly in open content there is nothing except some Wikipedia pages that can be freely quoted and used by the community. So this is one move towards cre­ating these resources.

At present, we can say that Hindi is spread over whole of India with different slang and understanding and we should take this point as an important one that as Hindi is understood by a large and different popula­tion. So being a translator we need to be more cautious in translating into Hindi. For the wider acceptability and to lessen the confusion, we should follow one particular style and convention for the language. Therefore this guide is prepared for Hindi and its translators and localisers communities.

## 2. What is Hindi?

According to WikiPedia, Hindi (Devan gar : ā ī हहनदद or हहहदद, IAST: Hind , IPA: [ī ˈɦɪndi ]) is the name givenː to various Indo­Aryan languages, dialects, and language registers spoken in northern and central India (the Hindi belt), Pakistan, Fiji, Mauritius, and Suriname. Standard Hindi, a standardized register of Hindustani, is one of the 22 scheduled  languages of India and  the primary official language of the Indian Union. In the broadest sense of the word, "Hindi" refers to the Hindi languages, a culturally defined part of a dialect contin­ uum that covers the "Hindi belt" of northern India. It includes Bhojpuri, an important language not only of In­ dia but, due to 19th and 20th century migrations, of Surinam, Guyana, Trinidad and Mauritius, where it is called Hindi or Hindustani; and Awadhi, a medieval literary standard in India and the Hindi of Fiji. Standard Hindi is the official language of India and is the most widely spoken of India's scheduled languages. It is spo­ ken mainly in northern states of Rajasthan, Delhi, Haryana, Uttarakhand, Uttar Pradesh, Madhya Pradesh, Chhattisgarh, Himachal Pradesh, Jharkhand and Bihar. It is the second major language in Andaman and Nico­ bar Islands and is also understood in Maharashtra and Gujarat. Hindi is the official language of India. It is also the official languages for 11 states.

Hindi language is mainly written in Devanagari. Devanagari (pronounced / de v nˌ ɪ əˈ ɑːɡə ːri /; Hindustani: [ e na ri];  dd ːʋˈ ːɡददवननगरद Devan gar ) is written from left to right, does not have distinct letter cases, and is recā ī ­ ognizable by a horizontal line runs along the top of full letters by joining a word. Devan gar  is the mainā ī script used to write Standard Hindi, Marathi, and Nepali. Since the 19th century, it has been the most com­ monly used script for Sanskrit. Devan gar  is also employed for Bhojpuri, Gujari, Pahari (Garhwali and Kuā ī ­ maoni), Konkani, Magahi, Maithili, Marwari, Bhili, Newari, Santhali, Tharu, and sometimes Sindhi, Sherpa and Kashmiri. It was formerly used to write even Gujarati. So the effect of several languages can be seen in the making of Hindi language since it is spoken in large geographic area of India. If we count by combining both first and second language status, this language is being understood by almost 70 percent of the popula­ tion of India. Apart from Sanskrit and Prakrit, Hindi is very much influenced by Persian. In Hindi, so there is only two gender where Gujarati and Marathi like Sanskrit based languages are still have one neuter gender. Hindi lexicon  has taken a sizable nos of word from Persian and English along with other regional languages and dialects. Now a days the case of code switching and code mixing are also a common phenomena in Hindi.

## 3. Who should translate?..

This is a very basic question. Who should translate? A general assumption is that anybody who knows the two languages, ie the source language and the target language, can translate. It is entirely not true. Trans­ lation is an art. It needs a level of experience, a good level of knowledge of the subject matter being translated and art of translating. Being native is one of the important criteria and it should be also. Just you are native, you know the sev­ eral inherent complexity of the language easily. But it is noted that nativity is not a static thing. If you live away from your native language speaking area from long time, it is being eroded slowly and in this condition, there is a tendency of forgetting the small know­how of the language as well. So in this case, it is imperative that a translator should enrich  him/herself by listening native language news, reading newspaper, magazine and attending conferences related to native language issues etc. But being native should not be the only criteria. Expertise on subject matter and experience of doing translation are added advantage for a person interested in doing the translation. So if any person who is new to this field, s/he should be aware of what already has happened in the field or community if the project is under any community participation.

Translation is not just a profession. Translation creates a bridge between two distinct culture, two dis­tinct locale. So it needs, apart from just professionalism, a feeling towards your language, a passion to see your language on computer, mobile, web or any hand held device. On one mailing list, one of my friend once wrote, “ computer aur mobile par Hindiyane ka sukh shayad sabse alag aur anokha sukha hota hai .” The scene of ICT is changing very fast and it is our duty to create all computing related interface a great place for Hindi.

## 4. GENERAL TRANSLATIONS

## GUIDELINES

Before starting translating in Hindi, there are few things we must know For example, Fonts, Collation, Numerals, Calendar, Acronym, Glossaries, Punctuations, White Spaces, Message Lengths, to name a few.

### 4.1 FONTS

For Translating any documents or any application in Hindi language, we need to use Unicode based De­vanagari fonts. Eg. Lohit, Sarai etc. The font should contain a glyph for each allocated code point prescribed by Unicode. The font should contain the following: (1) vowels; (2) consonants; (3) glyphs for conjuncts; (4) variants for vowel signs (matras), (5) vowel modifiers (Chandrabindu, Anuswar), (6)  consonant modifier (Nukta); (7) digits and (8) punctuation marks.

### 4.2. COLLATIONS

Collation order is not the same as Unicode point order. There are lot of convention also for collation. So we will follow the collation table prescribed by Unicode. For collation chart, please check here: http://unicode.org/charts/collation/chart_Devanagari.html

  ### 4.3. PLURAL FORMS

There are a lot of languages which have more than one plural form. Sometimes it comes as embedded with strings and sometimes properly defined plural forms. By properly defining plural forms header, you will get the correct no of fields. For Hindi:

FIX TABLE
Language Name Code Category Examples Rules
Hindi hi One 0, 1 one → n in
0..1; other →
Other 2-999; 1.31, 2.31... everything else

### 4.4. WHI TE S PAC ES

In computer science, white space is any single character or series of characters that represents horizontal or  vertical  space  in  typography.  When  rendered,  a white  space  character  does  not  correspond  to a visual mark, but typically does occupy an area on a page. There may be different pattern of any language related to white space. We should properly care and follow the source text and target language rules for placing any ex­ tra white space.

### 4.5. AC CELE RATO RS


Different applications uses different accelerator markers such as KDE and Mozilla uses ampersand, GNOME used underscore and OpenOffice uses tilde. Usually in Asian languages where a keyboard is western (en_US), generally original English accelerator is being used. So for translating in Hindi as well,  original Eng­ lish accelerators are being be used. So we should follow this conventions. We generally put the accelerators at the end of translated strings in the parentheses with the respective accelerator marker.

### 4.6. PRO G RAM SY NTA X, FUN CTIO N S, TAG S, PLAC EHO LD ERS

Never translate program syntax or functions or tags, place holders. Sometimes some translators translate
these as well. We should not translate any of these. This creates major error in translation.

### 4.7. MESS AG E LENG TH

The message length is an important aspect of any translation particularly in technical translation areas. The message length should not exceed more than 20 percentage of the number of words present in the source text . Though it takes time to make translation concise, but there is big need to concentrate on this aspect.

### 4.8. NUME RAL S


We will use International form of Indian Numerals in translation instead of Devanagari numerals. How­
ever, the employment of Devanagari numerals is same as Indian numerals. So we will use 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7,
8, and 9 instead of ०, १, २, ३, ४, ५, ६, ७, ८ and ९.

### 4.9. CAL EN DER


The Indian national calendar (sometimes called Saka calendar) is the official civil calendar in use in In­
dia. It is used, alongside the Gregorian calendar, by The Gazette of India, news broadcasts by All India Radio,
and calendars and communications issued by the Government of India.

### 4.10. HO NO RI FI C US AG ES


It is encouraged to use honorific pronoun in Hindi. So, it is better to use words like आप, यद, वद instead of
तसम, यह, वह respectively. Along with this, we should not translate like ढसूएढलो, खलोजलो, करलो etc. Saying anything like
this are being seen as rude in Hindi.

### 4.11. ACRO NYMS


Acronyms and initialisms are abbreviations that are formed using the initial components in a phrase or
name. These components may be individual letters. The term acronym is the name for a word created from
the first letters of each word in a series of words. Acronyms and initialisms are used most often to abbreviate
names of organizations and long or frequently referenced terms, or any products. In the case of acronyms as a
file name don't translate standard acronyms like Jpeg, HTML, xml to name a few. But in general if it is coming
we should translate.

For Product/Brand/Company Name, it is general rule accepted by agencies to keep as it is like English.
But  since  more  than  90 percent  of  people  is  not  aware  of  Roman  letters  and its  pronunciation,  so  better
transliterate it in Hindi and put it as a Brand name in English at its first instance.

### 4.14. ABB REVI ATIO NS



Abbreviations in Hindi are formed by the use of a dot or small circle (970 ॰ DEVANAGARI ABBREVIA­
TION SIGN) after the first syllable of the word that needs to be abbreviated. For example,  ईस्वद पसूवर is being
written as ई॰ पसू॰and Dr. Ram Sharan Sharma will be written as  डन॰ रन॰ एस॰ शमनर or डन. रन. एस. शमनर.

### 4.15. Legal Statements..


Generally every software has some sort of legal statements associated with the software. Translating le­
gal statements is general difficult as well as critical. So we should avoid to translate legal statements.

### 4.16. CU RRE NC Y


In India, Indian Rupee (INR) ie रपए is accepted as a currency of India. So if the audience of the transla­
tion is from India, so we should translate the amount of money for the ease in understanding because it is not
easier for a native user to understand the difference between 100 INR and 100 USD or any other currencies.

### 4.17. Dates and Times


    It should be noted that Dates and Times should be properly translated. If not it can create confusion much.
For 28 August 2010, international dating system represents 2010­08­28 but the American Usage is 8.28.10.
But in Hindi we write it like 28 अगस्त 2010 and it is represented as 28.8.10. So we should follow this conven­
tion  of  writing.  For  translating  time, using  colon  will  be  preferred  then just  putting  period.  For  example,
10:30 बजद.

Type Source Target Wrong | Target Correct ( )

14 | 4. General Translations Guidelines


## 5. Hindi Terminology


Terminology is one of the major area where everybody put their attention in translating any text. There
are currently two glossaries for Hindi.

### 5.1. FUEL Hindi


We will use  FUEL  as our primary glossary. You can find FUEL Hindi glossary from here in pdf format:
FUEL Hindi. For Other format of file please visit FUEL Hindi page on FUEL website.
FUEL is a community project working on the problems like inconsistencies and standardisation. The
FUEL Hindi terminology is released after a community meet in which the Hindi community discussed on all
the terms and later it is released as primary glossary. Please translate using this terminology with consistency.

## 6. Punctuations & Text Conventions.

## CONVENTIONS


The proper use of text convention and punctuations are very vital in any language. According to
Wikipedia, Punctuation marks are symbols that indicate the structure and organisation of written language, as
well as intonation and pauses to be observed when reading aloud. In written English, punctuation is vital to
disambiguate the meaning of sentences. For example, "woman, without her man, is nothing" and "woman:
without her, man is nothing" have greatly different meanings, as do "eats shoots and leaves" and "eats, shoots
and leaves". "King Charles  walked  and talked half an hour  after his head  was cut off" is alarming;  "King
Charles walked and talked; half an hour after, his head was cut off", less so. (For English usage, see the arti­
cles on specific punctuation marks.) The rules of punctuation vary with language, location, register and time
and are constantly evolving. Certain aspects of punctuation are stylistic and are thus the author's (or editor's)
choice. Tachygraphic language forms, such as those used in online chat and text messages, may have wildly
different rules. In this section, wikipedia references are mainly used to elaborate and define punctuations.
Here goes the major text convention and punctuations rules for Hindi.


| Text Conventions/Punctuations | Usage in English | Usages in Hindi |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Bold | Bold face text makes text darker than the surrounding text. With this technique, the emphasized text strongly stands out from the rest; it should therefore be used to highlight certain keywords that are important to the subject of the text, for easy visual scanning of text. | It is same as English. So please keep the Bold text as Bold in Hindi as well.|
| Italics | Text is written in a script style, or the use of oblique, where the vertical orientation of all letters is slanted to the left or right. With one or the other of these techniques (usually only one is available for any typeface), words can be highlighted without making them stand out much from the rest of the text (inconspicuous stressing). Traditionally, this is used for marking passages that have a different context, such as words from foreign languages, book titles, and the like. | It is same as English. So please keep the Italicized text as Italics.
| Capitalization | Capitalization is writing a word with its first letter as a majuscule (upper- case letter) and the remaining letters in minuscules (lower-case letters), in those writing systems which have a case distinction. The term is also used for the choice of case in text. | There is no upper case letters in Hindi. So in case we need to emphasize, can be done by increasing the font size. But it should be avoided as well. But making bold or italics is not a good way.

Ellipsis Ellipsis (plural ellipses; from the
Greek: λλειψις, élleipsis, ἔ
"omission") is a mark or series of
marks that usually indicate an
intentional omission of a word in the
original text. An ellipsis can also be
used to indicate a pause in speech,
an unfinished thought, or, at the end
of a sentence, a trailing off into
silence (aposiopesis) (apostrophe
and ellipsis mixed). When placed at
the end of a sentence, the ellipsis
can also inspire a feeling of
melancholy longing. The ellipsis calls
for a slight pause in speech.


The most common form of an ellipsis
is a row of three periods or full stops
(...) or pre-composed triple-dot glyph
(...). The usage of the em dash (—)
can overlap the usage of the ellipsis.

The triple-dot punctuation mark is
also called a suspension point,
points of ellipsis, periods of ellipsis,
or colloquially, dot-dot-dot. Ellipses is
written as one unit.

Same as English

Double Quote Quotation marks or inverted commas
(informally referred to as quotes[1]
and speech marks) are punctuation
marks used in pairs to set off
speech, a quotation, a phrase, or a
word. They come as a pair of
opening and closing marks in either
of two styles: single ('...') or double
("..."). Single or double quotation


Though it is the choice of the author
or translator, but it would be better if
it should be translated as English.

Whether Single or Double quotation
marks, the first of the pair is
generally inverted. It is similar to
other European languages other marks denote either speech or a
quotation. Neither style—single or
double—is an absolute rule, though
double quotation marks are preferred
in the United States, and both single
and double quotation marks are
used in the United Kingdom. A
publisher’s or author’s style may
take precedence over national
general preferences. The important
rule is that the style of opening and
closing quotation marks must be
matched.

Square Brackets Square brackets – also called simply
brackets (US) – are mainly used to
enclose explanatory or missing
material usually added by someone
other than the original author,
especially in quoted text.

Same as English

Curly Brackets Curly brackets – also called braces
(US) or flower brackets (India) – are
sometimes used in prose to indicate
a series of equal choices.

Same as English

Round Brackets Parentheses (singular, parenthesis)

- also called simply brackets (UK),
or round brackets, curved brackets,
oval brackets, or, colloquially, parens
- contain material that could be
omitted without destroying or altering


Same as English



the meaning of a sentence.
Parenthetical phrases have been
used extensively in informal writing
and stream of consciousness
literature. Parentheses may be used
in formal writing to add
supplementary information.

Inequality Signs The mathematical or logical symbols
for greater-than (>) and less-than (<)
are inequality operators, and are not
punctuation marks when so used.


Same as English

Angle Brackets Angle brackets or chevrons are often
used to enclose highlighted material.
Some dictionaries use chevrons to
enclose short excerpts illustrating the
usage of words. In Chinese
punctuation, angle brackets are used
as quotation marks. Half brackets
are used in English to mark added
text.


In general, not used in Hindi.

Full Stop/Period A full stop (British English) or period
(American English) is the
punctuation mark commonly placed
at the end of sentences. There
should be no space between last
letter and the period. If a title having
exclamation mark is coming at the
end of one sentence, we should not
put full stop.


Same as English. In Hindi, using '.'
or '।' is today a matter of preference.
Some prefer Period [. ] where some
uses 'Khadi Pai/Danda' [ । ]. In
Software translation, particularly in
open source period is being used.
Whatever you use, you should be
consistent throughout the
application. According to Unicode: In
Hindi typography, there should be a
visible amount of space before a
Danda.

Comma (,) Commas are often used to separate
clauses. In English, a comma is
generally used to separate a
dependent clause from the
independent clause if the dependent
clause comes first: After I brushed
the cat, I lint-rollered my clothes.
Two independent clauses joined by a
coordinating conjunction (for, and,
nor, but, or, yet, so) or having a
complementary relationship[4] may
or may not be separated by
commas, depending on preferred
style, or sometimes a desire to
overcome ambiguity.


Generally same as English.

Colon A colon [ : ] is used before a list or
any explanation that is coming next.


Since there is a character Visarga
(ःत) in Hindi similar to colon, so to
avoid the problem we should use
long dash instead of the colon. If we need want to use colon, we should
put one space before the colon.
Semi colon Semicolons are followed by a lower
case letter, unless that letter is the
first letter of a proper noun. They
have no spaces before them, but
one space after (possibly two when
using monospaced fonts). The
semicolon (;) is a punctuation mark
with several uses. The Italian printer
Aldus Manutius the Elder established
the practice of using the semicolon
mark to separate words of opposed
meaning, and to indicate
interdependent statements.[1] The
earliest, general use of the
semicolon in English was in 1591;
Ben Jonson was the first notable
English writer to use them
systematically. The modern uses of
the semicolon relate either to the
listing of items, or to the linking of
related clauses.

Same as English

Question Mark A question mark [? ] is used at the
end of any direct question. But in
indirect question, it is not used. In
general, we should avoid using
question mark with other punctuation
mark (eg. [ !? ]).

Same as English.

Exclamation Mark An exclamation mark, exclamation
point, shout pole, or bang (!) is a
punctuation mark usually used after
an interjection or exclamation to
indicate strong feelings or high
volume, and often marks the end of
a sentence. There should be no
space between last letter and the
exclamation mark. If a title having
exclamation mark is coming at the
end of one sentence, we should not
put full stop. Example: "Watch out!"
The character is encoded in Unicode
at U+0021.

Same as English. In general, Hindi
error messages end with
exclamation mark.

Slash A slash is generally being used to
show choice between words it
separates. The slash is also used to
indicate a line break when quoting
multiple lines from a poem, play, or
headline.

Same in Hindi.

Apostrophe An apostrophe is used in English to
indicate possession. The practice

No apostrophe is used in Hindi.


ultimately derives from the Old
English genitive case: the “of” case,
itself used as a possessive in many
languages. The genitive form of
many nouns ended with the inflection
-es, which evolved into a simple -s
for the possessive ending. An
apostrophe was later added to
replace the omitted e, not his as is
and was widely believed.

## 7. UNITS AND

## MEASUREMENTS


The  Republic of  India  adopted the  metric  system  on April 1,  1957. So  basic  measurement units  for
weight is gram/kilogram, length is meter/kilometer, liquid volume is milliliter/liter. It is the correct and ac­
cepted way for Hindi as well. However, other units are still prevalent but particularly for technical translation,
we need to follow the metric system. Except for measuring body temperature, generally temperature in India
is measured in Celsius. So for Hindi translation, it should be changed in Celsius if in source language, it is in
different units.

## 8. GENERAL SPELLING

## GUIDELINES


Due to large volume of population and extreme geographical and cultural diversity, there are lot of prob­
lems related to the consistency of the spelling in Hindi. Here are the few points that we should consider dur­
ing translating any text in Hindi.

### 8.1. AN USVAR AN D CH AND RAVI ND U


In the Devanagari script, Anusvar (0902 ःह DEVANAGARI SIGN ANUSVARA) is represented with a dot
(bindu) above the letter (मह). Chandravindu (0901 ःए DEVANAGARI SIGN CANDRABINDU) (meaning "moon­
dot" in Sanskrit, alternatively spelled candrabindu, chandravindu, candravindu, or chôndrobindu) is a dia­
critic sign having the form of a dot inside the lower half of a circle. In Standard Hindi, the anusv ra is tradiā ­
tionally defined as representing a nasal consonant homorganic to a following stop, in contrast to the candra­
bindu (anun sika), which indicates vowel nasalization. In practice, however, the two are often used interā ­
changeably. But the reason for using it interchangeably is not correct. Use of nasalisation sign ie chan­
dravindu is necessary to avoid any confusion in meaning. हहस­हएस is one of the famous example. Earlier print­
ing days were not as easy as of today in this digital days. So that time making difference in between chan­
dravindu and anusvar was difficult. But time has changed now and so we need to use these properly. If fifth
consonant comes with any of the four remaining consonants of the same class, Anusvar is being used. Even all
textbooks of NCERT have convention to use both the anusvar and chandravindu in proper ways. Hindi lan­
guage alphabets and its each chars are of great phonetic importance and so preserving these variations would
be necessary. So better we need to use these mark correctly.

### 8.2. USE O F NUKTA


Nukta  [093C, ः ़ Devanagari  Sign  Nukta]  is  a generic  term  for  the diacritic  mark  in  several  Brahmic
scripts, like Devanagari that is used to represent sounds from other languages by being applied to an existing
character. The word nukta, originates from the Arabic word.
We should encourage the use of Nukta where use in innate form is desired. There are lot of words which
lose its essence without a nukta. Sometimes not using it gives us different meaning as well. But we need to
take precaution in using nukta. The Hindi and Hindi Edition of all books of NCERT (National Council of Edu­
cational Research and Training) used nukta properly and so it can be told that the people and students study­
ing in CBSE are well aware of the nukta use. eg. We should always write like फनइल not as फिनइल without nukta.

### 8.3. Case Signs..


 In Hindi, Case Signs are always written as separate words. For example, करूणनकर नद, लड़कद कलो etc. There is
one exception to it. When between pronoun and case sign, particles comes, then it will be written separately.
When हद comes in between आप and कद, then we will write it like this: आप हद कद ललए.

### 8.4. TRA NSLI TE RATI O N O F FO REIG N WO RDS


The transliteration of foreign words should be done consistently and we would prefer to use Father
Camile Bulke English to Hindi Dictionary. According to the recommendation by  Commission for Scientific and
Technical Terminology, "The transliteration of English terms should not be made so complex as to necessitate
the introduction of new signs and symbols in the present Devanagari characters. The Devanagari rendering of
English terms should aim at maximum approximation to the standard English pronunciation with such modifi­
cations as are prevalent in the educated circle in India."  We should try to follow these recommendation for
words adopted from other languages.

### 8.5. CA RDI NA LS, OR DI NAL S, MULTI PLI C ATI VE AN D FRA CTIO N



Cardinal numeral forms should be used correctly. Generally we should try to avoid single digit numbers
except where required. Like cardinals we should use ordinals correctly.

### 8.6. Indeclinable


Indeclinable should be written separately. Honorific Indeclinable should also be written separately. But
compound Indeclinables should be written together.   For example,  यहनए तक,  शद रहवकननत,  प्रहतहदन etc. Hyphen
should be placed before some particles, co­ordinative compounds, and dependent determinative compounds

### 8.7. HYP HE N


Hyphen should be placed before some particles, co­ordinative compounds, and dependent determinative
compounds. e.g.  गनलोम­कद डदई,  भसू­तत्व, ललनक्स­सन.

### 8.8. GLI DA L I E SHR UTIMU LAK 'YA' O R 'WA'


The use of glidal ie शसहतमसूलक 'य' and 'व' should be avoided if it is optional.

## 9. Basic Quality Parameters....


While translating any text in Hindi, we need to follow basic quality parameters to keep our translation
better. These parameters are just for reference. There can be several variations of parameters but here are
some important just to understand errors arising out of the violation of parameters. Several translation agen­
cies are there who did lot of labour in creating parameters. Followings are some outlines what parameters can
be and why we need to give importance to parameters.

### 9.1. Accuracy


Accuracy is an important characteristic of any technical translation.   Accuracy refers to preserving the
meaning of  the  original text.  The term accurate  is essentially  synonymous  with  the  term faithfulness, but
some translation theoreticians differentiate between the two terms. A translation which is accurate is faithful
to the intended meaning of the  original author. Notice that, a translation can be coherent and cohesive but
inaccurate. The error creating difference in the meaning, adding or omitting something, difference in headers
and footers etc. can be termed as the error of accuracy.

### 9.2. Language and Grammar...


The evaluation of a translation with regards to the grammatical components must be governed by the cri­
terion of correctness. Like most of the developed  language Hindi is also having a grammar and following
grammar is necessary for consistent and standard text. Any popular grammar book like 'हहहदद व्यनकरण ' of Kamta
Prasad Guru (कनमतन प्रसनद गसर ) can be accepted as reference. We should not do any mistake of grammar,  spelling,
and punctuation.

### 9.3. Terminology..


Terminology is focused on the meaning and conveyance of concepts. The quality of a translation depends
on the consistency in use of terms belonging to   a specialised area of usage and appropriateness to context.
We should use prescribed glossaries and industry related words and register in doing translation. The devia­
tion from prescribed glossary, using inconsistent terminology are are errors of terminology.

### 9.4. Comprehensibility..


Translations should be comprehensible and understandable not only for its translators but for its readers.
Translators should avoid unnecessary words or expressions that may confuse the readers.

### 9.5. Culture Specific..


Sometimes, something in the culture of the source language has a distinctly different cultural value from
the same thing in the culture of the target language. In such cases, the translator should keep the original
meaning by adjusting the form of the cultural symbol or adding enough background information to indicate to
the target language users what the original cultural value was. We should follow country specific standards
and cultural references and local conventions in doing translation. For example, we should use metric system.
We should use Rupee instead of Dollar during translation.

## 10. Conclusion.


In this guide,  effort is given to encompass all major language related areas for Hindi. By following this
guide, we assume that we can create a content in more consistent and standardised way. But we cannot say
that the list given above is final. We can add several areas as well but to be precise and brief, we have ignored

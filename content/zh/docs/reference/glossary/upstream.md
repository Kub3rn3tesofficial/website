 May refer to: core Kubernetes or the source repo from which a repo was forked.

<!--more--> 
<!--
* In the **Kubernetes Community**: Conversations often use *upstream* to mean the core Kubernetes codebase, which the general ecosystem, other code, or third-party tools relies upon. For example, [community members](#term-member) may suggest that a feature is moved upstream so that it is in the core codebase instead of in a plugin or third-party tool.
* In **GitHub** or **git**: The convention is to refer to a source repo as *upstream*, whereas the forked repo is considered *downstream*.

可以参考：核心 Kubernetes 或来自 repo fork的源代码库。

* 在**Kubernetes社区**：对话通常使用*upstream*来表示核心 Kubernetes 代码库，这是一般生态系统，其他代码或第三方工具所依赖的。 例如，[community members]（#term-member）可能会建议向上游移动某个功能，使其位于核心代码库中，而不是移动到插件或第三方工具中。
* 在**GitHub**或**git**中：约定是将源代码称为*upstream*，而forked repo则被视为*downstream*。

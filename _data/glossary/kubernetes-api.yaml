short-description: |
  The foundation for how Kubernetes represents and stores the state of the cluster.
long-description: |
  Kubernetes resources and "records of intent" are all stored as API objects, and modified via REST calls to the API. The API allows configuration to be managed in a declarative way.
  Users can interact with the Kubernetes API directly, or via tools like `kubectl`. The core Kubernetes API if flexible and can also be extended to support custom resources.

short-description: >
 A Secret is an object that contains a small amount of sensitive data such as a password, a token, or a key.
long-description: >
  It allows for more control over how such information is used, and reduces the risk of accidental exposure. A secret can be used with a {% glossary_tooltip term_id="pod" %} in two ways: as files in a volume mounted on one or more of its containers, or used by kubelet when pulling images for the {% glossary_tooltip term_id="pod" %}.

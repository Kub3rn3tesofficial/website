short-description: >
  An API object that injects information like secrets, volume mounts,
  and environment variables into pods at creation time.
long-description: >
  This object chooses the pods to inject information into with the
  standard selectors. This allows the podspec definitions to be
  nonspecific, decoupling the podspec from environment specific
  configuration.

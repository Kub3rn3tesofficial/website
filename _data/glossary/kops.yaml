short-description: |
  A CLI tool that helps you create, destroy, upgrade and maintain production-grade, highly available, Kubernetes clusters. *Officially supports AWS only, with GCE and VMware vSphere in alpha*.
long-description: |
  `kops` provisions your cluster with the following opinionated approach&#58;

    * Fully automated installation
    * DNS-based cluster identification
    * Self-healing&#58; everything runs in Auto-Scaling Groups
    * Limited OS support (Debian preferred, Ubuntu 16.04 supported, early support for CentOS & RHEL)
    * High-Availability support
    * The ability to directly provision, or generate terraform manifests

  If your opinions differ from these you may prefer to build your own cluster using `kubeadm` as a building block. `kops` builds on the kubeadm work.

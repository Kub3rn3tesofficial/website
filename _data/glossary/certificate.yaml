  Certificates are used to enable applications within a kubernetes
  cluster to access the kubernetes API securely. They validate that
  clients are allowed to access the API.

  The process of creating a valid certificate includes creating a
  Certificate Signing Request, and having that approved by the
  kubernetes adminstrator using the ``kubectl certificate`` command.

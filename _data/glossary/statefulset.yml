short-description: |
  A Controller that provides a unique identity to its Pods. It provides guarantees about the ordering of deployment and scaling.
long-description: |
  StatefulSets are valuable for applications that require one or more of the following.

  * Stable, unique network identifiers.
  * Stable, persistent storage.
  * Ordered, graceful deployment and scaling.
  * Ordered, graceful deletion and termination.
  * Ordered, automated rolling updates.

  In the above, stable is synonymous with persistence across Pod (re)scheduling. If an application doesn't require any stable identifiers or ordered deployment, deletion, or scaling, you should deploy your application with a controller that provides a set of stateless replicas. Controllers such as [Deployment](/docs/concepts/workloads/controllers/deployment/) or [ReplicaSet](/docs/concepts/workloads/controllers/replicaset/) may be better suited to your stateless needs.

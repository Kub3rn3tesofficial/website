short-description: |
  Able to both review and approve K8s code contributions.
long-description: |
  While code review is focused on code quality and correctness, approval is focused on holistic acceptance of a contribution including&#58; backwards/forwards compatibility, adhering to API and flag conventions, subtle performance and correctness issues, interactions with other parts of the system, etc.

  *Approver status is scoped to a part of the codebase.*
